# About me

Hello, I'm *Sebastian Paintner*

I'm a `frontend developer`, or sometimes also `fullstack developer`, with already some years of real life
work experience.

I was interested in **coding** since early in school. Back then I was trying to create little games or
just play around with everything that I found interesting.

After a little detour of studying **electrical engineering** it took me back to programming in my
bachelors thesis. There I did a case study for the **MÃ¼nchner Verkehrs Gesellschaft (MVG)**. They
wanted to see in real time what was going on in their underground trains. So I built them a
dashboard where they could pick a train to see the footage from inside.

From there on I started working as a `web engineer` and went pretty quick into the direction of
`frontend engineering`. After almost 7 years of working in this field I'm longing for some change.
I got more and more interested in combining my skills in programming with other fields. Thats why I
started to do some projects for my self and clients that are more than just a simple website.

Getting more into these projects I found the study program of `design computation` and this sounds
exactly what I'm looking for to get even more into interdisciplinary work.
