# Welcome to my portfolio page

**Hello, I'm *Sebastian Paintner***

a **fullstack developer** but mostly focused on the **frontend**, with already some years of real life work experience.

I was interested in **coding** since early in school. Back then I was trying to create little games or
just play around with everything that I found interesting.

After a little detour of studying **electrical engineering** it took me back to programming in my
bachelors thesis. There I did a case study for the **MÃ¼nchner Verkehrs Gesellschaft (MVG)**, of how
to monitor the inside of their trains and present it to the control room.

From there on I started working as a **web engineer** and went pretty quick into the direction of
**frontend engineering**. After almost 7 years of working in this field I'm longing for some change.
I got more and more interested in combining my skills in programming with other fields.
Thats why I started to do some projects that are more than just a simple website.

Getting more into these projects I found the study program of **design computation** and it sounds
exactly what I was looking for.

So far about me. Now I want to present to you some selected projects which I think are relevant for
applying to this study program.

**The projects:**

1. An augmented reality web app I made for [slanted](https://www.slanted.de/).
2. An artwork generator website made with [p5js](https://p5js.org/).
3. And a light installation made out of a mate box.

All these projects combine programming with other disciplines, like **art** or **electrical engineering**.
This makes them really interesting for me!

**How to navigate this page:**

Every project is presented in detail over the next pages.
