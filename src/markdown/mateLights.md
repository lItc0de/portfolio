# Light installation in a *mate* box

Before the pandemic I was regulary attending the `chaos communication congress (CCC)` and was very
inspired by all the nice installations that are presented there every year. One of them I liked
paticulary well. It was a light installation made of mate boxed and bottles.

The architecture is pretty simple:
1. Have a box of empty mate bottles.
2. Drill a hole into every lid that is big enough to fit a LED light.
3. Cover the sides of the bottle to only let the light go out at the bottom.
4. Get some programmable LEDs and put them into the lid holes.
5. Connect the LEDs to a adrunio and a power supply.
6. Programm the LEDs to light up.
