##### Future improvements

I already have a lot ideas of how to fit the artworks better to a track.
Some of the ideas include:
- Being able to select genres or other categories related to the music style.
- Choose colors that you want to have in the artwork.
- Have multiple versions created at the same time and let the user pick the one they like most.
- Upload the track, analyze it and create the artwork based on that data.
