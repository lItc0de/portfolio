##### The idea

As I'm listening a lot to music on *soundcloud* and almost every track there has some nice artwork,
I was wondering how much effort it is to create these. I guess it is a lot, either you hire a artist
to create one for you or you do it yourself. In both cases it takes some time and probably also
money to do so. So I thought let's make this more easy by providing a web page where artists can
create an artwork in seconds for free.

To create the artwork I wanted to use `p5.js` and create a random image everytime a user enters the
webpage.
