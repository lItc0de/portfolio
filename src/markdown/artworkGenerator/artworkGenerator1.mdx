##### Project #2

# Generate an unique *artwork* for your track

A friend of mine gifted me a *riso* print with some nice abstract art on it. I asked her how she
created it and she said she used the [processing language](https://processing.org/) to do so.

This got my interest and I also wanted to play arount with it. After reading for a bit on their
webpage I found out that there also is a javascript implementation of this called
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
So my first thought was nice, I can use that to do some nice backgrounds and animations for websites.

After playing with it for a while and being astonished by the possibilities I wanted to do
something useful with it.
