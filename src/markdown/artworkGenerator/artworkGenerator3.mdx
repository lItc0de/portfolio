##### First step *MVP*

This is still a work in progress idea and I first wanted to create a page with some minimal required
features.

The page needs to include:
1. Generating the random artwork
2. Showing the artwork to the user
3. Have a button to regenerate
4. Have a button to save the artwork

You can see the still in progress implementation of the **artwork generator**
[here](https://lol.example).

On the next pages you can see some **screenshots** of the website and two **generated artworks**.
