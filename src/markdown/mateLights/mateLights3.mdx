<title>Mate lights | Portfolio</title>

##### Architecture of the box

1. Have a box of empty mate bottles.
2. Drill a hole into every lid that is big enough to fit a LED light.
3. Cover the sides of the bottle to only let the light go out at the bottom.
4. Get some programmable LEDs and put them into the lid holes.
5. Connect the LEDs to a adruino and a power supply.
6. Programm the LEDs to light up.

The next pages will show you how I built it.
