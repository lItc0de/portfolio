##### Conclusion and future plans

I was surprised how **easy** it was to build this project with the help of the **internet**.
It was fun to create something you can actually **touch**, as I'm normally only creating web pages.
The goal to have some **nice lightings** in a **mate box** for parties was achieved, but I'm already
thinking further.

It would be nice to be able to control the **lights** with a smartphone **app** to change the
**colours** or make it react to the **music** you are playing.
Maybe it would also be cool to have more **mate lights boxes**, put them together and then use the
lights as **pixels** to write some **text**.
