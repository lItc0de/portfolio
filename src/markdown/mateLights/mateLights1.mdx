# Light installation in a *mate* box

Before the pandemic I was regularly attending the **chaos communication congress (CCC)** and was very
inspired by all the nice **art installations** that are presented there every year.
One of them I liked particularly well.
It was a light installation made of **mate box** and **bottles**.
