##### How the app works

1. The user selects a **chapter** they are reading.
2. To use the **augmented reallity feature** they have to allow access to the smartphone's camera.
3. Point the smartphone's **camera** to the images in the magazine.
4. The app detects an **image** via a **marker** and shows the related **video**.

As a help for the user, images with related videos are marked with a little **play icon** in the
bottom right.

The next pages will show an example of the magazine with a **detectable image** and a **video** of how
the app works.
