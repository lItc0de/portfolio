##### User jurney:
First the user selects the **chapter** they are reading. To use the augmented reallity feature the
user then has to allow access to the smartphone's camera. Then they can start pointing the
smartphone to the magazine to discover the images and watch the videos. To know which image has a
video, the images are marked with a little play button on the bottom right.
The next page will show a <Link to="/arSlanted6/">video</Link> with an example of how the app works.
