##### Project #1
# Augemted Reality Website for *slanted*

The first project I want to present to you is an `augmented reality` web app created for the Slanted
Magazine. It is used in this edition:
[Slanted Magazine #37â€”AI](https://www.slanted.de/product/slanted-magazine-37-ai/)

For this edition of the magazine slanted wanted to present videos for some of the images.
So the aim of the web app was to connect the magazine with the reader's smartphone to show related
videos.

To acheive this the plan was not to use simple `QR-Codes` but to detect an **image** in the magazine
and the play the related video.

The next pages will show some impressions of the magazine.
