# Augemted Reality Website for *slanted*

The first project I want to present to you is an **augmented reality** web app created for the
**slanted magazine**, which is used in this edition of the magazine:
[Slanted Magazine #37â€”AI](https://www.slanted.de/product/slanted-magazine-37-ai/).

The main topic of that edition is **artificial intelligence** and while creating the content it also
resulted in some videos.

To show the videos slanted wanted a web app that can **discover images** in the magazine and then play
the **related videos**.
