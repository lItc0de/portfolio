##### Problem #3

###### Not every browser is created equal

On mobile it didn't work well with every browser, so I had to find a workaround for browsers where
the `AR functionality` didn't work as expected.

The solution of this problem was quite easy. Browsers where it didn't work well just don't use the
`AR functionality`. Instead they show a fallback page where the user can select the image from the
magazine by it's title.
