##### Technology used:
The base is a simple static website created with [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
On top of it I'm using [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/), which is a library
designed to bring **augmented reality** to the web. It's features include **image tracking**,
**location based AR** and **marker tracking**.

For this use-case I was picking the **marker tracking** functionality because with that it is possible
to create **markers** for many different images and then show content when thy are detected by the
library.

The idea itself, creating **markers** for images, load them into the library and show content based on
what was found, sounds pretty easy, but there have been some problems to solve which I will explain
over the next pages.
