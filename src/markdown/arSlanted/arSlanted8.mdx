##### Problem #1

###### Performance issues with multiple markers

At the time of implementation the library was not jet designed to include a large ammount of
`markers` and track them without creating `preformance issues`.

The plan was to track `47 images` over `8 chapters` of the magazine but this just didn't work.
So I had to come up with a solution for this problem.
In my research I found out that it is possible to track around `12 markers` at the same time without
creating performance issues.
The fix then was to split the `images` into groups and load the `markers` only for one group at the
same time.

Then next question that arrises is how to split the images over the magazine?
There I got pretty lucky with the distribution in the `8 chapters`.
The chapter with the most images includes `14` and this was still ok for the performance.
So in the end the website was seperated into the `8 chapters` and for every chapter only the
included images were tracked.
