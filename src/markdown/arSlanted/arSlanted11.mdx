##### Conclusion

All in all I was pretty happy with the result, even when not everything worked as expected.
In the process of creating the website I learned a lot about marker tracking and got interested in doing
more **augmented reality** projects.

For the future I would like to understand the mechanisms behind the **AR.js** library and maybe even
build my own library, to solve some of the problems I encountered.
Also it would be very interesting for me to find out what else is possible with **augmented reality**,
how we can benefit from using it in our society, where it makes sense and where not.
