# Welcome to my portfolio page

This website presents three of my latest projects:

- The [Augmented Reality website](https://www.slanted.de/ai/) I made for [slanted](https://www.slanted.de/)
- An artwork generator website made with [p5js](https://p5js.org/)
- And a light installation made with a mate crate

I chose these projects because they combine different fields of knowledge, what makes them
interesting for me.

Every project has their own site with more information.

You can navigate to via the `arrow keys` of your keyboard or by
clicking the arrows on the screen.
