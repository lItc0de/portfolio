<title>Augmented Reality | Portfolio</title>

##### Conclusion

All in all I was pretty happy with the result, even when not everything worked as expected. In the
process of creating the website I learnd a lot about marker tracking and got interested in doing
more `augmented reality` projects.
For the future I would like to understand the mechanisms behind the `AR.js` library and maybe even
build my own library, to solve some of the problems I encountered.
Also it would be very interesting for me to find out what else is possible with `augmented reality`,
how we can benefit from using it in our society, where it makes sense and where not.
