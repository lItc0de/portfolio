# Welcome to my portfolio page

This website presents three of my latest projects:

- The [Augmented Reality website](https://www.slanted.de/ai/) I made for [slanted](https://www.slanted.de/)
- An artwork generator website made with [p5js](https://p5js.org/)
- And a light installation made with a mate crate

I chose these projects because they combine different fields of knowledge, what makes them
interesting for me.

Every project has their own site with more information.

You can navigate to via the `arrow keys` of your keyboard or by

## About me

Hello, I'm *Basti*

I was interested in coding since early in school. Back then I was trying to create little games and
everything that I found interesting.

After a little detour of studying electrical engineering it took me back to programming in my
bachelors thesis. There I did a case study of how to integrate footage from underground wagons of
the munich undergrond network into a dashboard for the control room for the
`MÃ¼nchner Verkehrs Gesellschaft` (MVG).

From there on I started working as a `web engineer` and went pretty quick into the direction of
`frontend engineering`. After almost 7 years of working in this field I'm longing for some change.
I got more and more interested in combining my skills in programming with other fields. Thats why I
started to do some projects for my self and clients that are more than just a simple website.

Getting more into these projects I found the study program of `design computation` and this sounds
exactly what I'm looking for to get even more into interdisciplinary work.
