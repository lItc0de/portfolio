# Welcome to my portfolio page

This website presents three of my latest projects:

- The [Augmented Reality website](https://www.slanted.de/ai/) I made for [slanted](https://www.slanted.de/)
- An artwork generator website made with [p5js](https://p5js.org/)
- And a light installation made with a mate crate

All these projects combine programming with other disciplines, like art or electrical engineering.
This makes them really interesting for me!

###### This website is structured like this:

On the next pages you can see a little information about me followed by more detailed descriptions
of the projects.

You can navigate the page on `desktop` via the **arrow keys** of your keyboard, on `mobile` by
**clicking** on the **right** or **left** side of your screen (just like in instagram stories) or
simply by clicking the **arrows** on the screen.
