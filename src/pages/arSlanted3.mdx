<title>Augmented Reality | Portfolio</title>

##### User jurney:
In this <Link to="/arSlanted2/">video</Link> you could see an example of how the app works.
First the user selects the **chapter** they are reading. To use the augmented reallity feature the
user then has to allow access to the smartphone's camera. Then they can start pointing the
smartphone to the magazine to discover the images and watch the videos. To know which image has a
video, the images are marked with a little play button on the bottom right.


##### Technology used:
The base is a simple static website created with [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
On top of it I'm using [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/), which is a library
designed to bring `augmented reality` to the web. It's features include `image tracking`,
`location based AR` and `marker tracking`.

For this usecase I was picking the `marker tracking` functionality because with that it is possible
to create `markers` for many different pictures and then show content when thy are detected by the
library.

The idea itself, creating `markers` for images, load them into the library and show content based on
what was found, sounds pretty easy, but there have been some problems to solve.
