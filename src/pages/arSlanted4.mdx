## Problems

### Performance issues with multiple markers
#### At the time of implementation the library was not jet designed to include a large ammount of `markers` and track them without creating `preformance issues`.

But the plan was to track `47 images` over `8 chapters` of the magazine. So I had to come up with a
solution for this problem. In my research I found out that it is possible to track around
`12 markers` at the same time without creating performance issues. So the idea was to split the
`images` into groups of around `12 markers`. There I got pretty lucky with the distribution of
images over the `8 chapters`. The chapter with the most images includes `14` and this was still ok
for the performance. So in the end the website was seperated into the `8 chapters` and for every
chapter only the included images are tracked.
