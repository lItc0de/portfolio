<title>Artwork generator | Portfolio</title>

##### First step *MVP*

This is still a work in progress idea and I first wanted to create a page with some minimal required
features.

The page needs to include:
1. Generating the random artwork
2. Showing the artwork to the user
3. Have a button to regenerate
4. Have a button to save the artwork

You can see the still in progress implementation of the **artwork generator**
[here](https://lol.example).

##### Future improvements

I already have a lot ideas of how to fit the artworks better to a track.
Some of the ideas include:
- Being able to select genres or other categories related to the music style.
- Choose colors that you want to have in the artwork.
- Have multiple versions created at the same time and let the user pick the one they like most.
- Upload the track, analyze it and create the artwork based on that data.
