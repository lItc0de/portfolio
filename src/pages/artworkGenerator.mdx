# Generate unique *artwork* for your track

A friend of mine was doing some *riso* prints of sketches she did with the
[processing language](https://processing.org/) and gave one to me. I got interested in how she
created it and found out there is a javascript version of this. So my first thought was nice, I can
use that to do some nice backgrounds and animations for websites.

After playing with it for a while and being astonished by the possibilities of it I wanted to do
something useful with it. As I'm listening a lot to music on *soundcloud* I'm seeing all the nice
artwork for tracks and was thinking how can I make it easy for new users that don't have money to
pay for designers doing their artwork. So I came up with the plan for creating a website that
gernererates a random artwork everytime you visit that page.

## First step *MVP*
To get started I want the site to have only the minimal required features:
1. Generating the random artwork
2. Showing the artwork to the user
3. Have a button to regenerate
4. Have a button to save the artwork

## Future improvements
I was thinking for the future it would be nice to be able to select categories that then influence
the artwork that is generated. Categories could be e.g.: genres or moods, black and white or color,
and so on.
Also it would be nice to somehow let the artist upload their track, analyze it and then create a
artwork based on the data.
