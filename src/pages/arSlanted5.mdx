### Combining modern javascript framework with the library
#### AR.js is not designed to be used in a modern javascript frameworks like `react`. Therefore it was tricky to include it in a way that everything was starting up correctly (`marker loading` and access to the `camera`).

As I'm coming from a background of extensivly using modern frontend frameworks like `vuejs` or
`react` I didn't want to miss out on all the convenience it gives me.
`AR.js` is sadly not a module based javascript library and not avaliable via the
`node package manager (npm)`, so I had to include it directly into the `head` of the `html document`.
This has some implications, as it is polluting the `global namespace` with it's definitions and it
is harder to get control of loading times and code execution times. So I hade to make sure that the
timings, of when is the react app loaded and when is the `AR.js library` loaded, correct. Luckily
there is some tooling around `react` called `gatsbyjs` that makes it easy to render the webpages on
the server side and only serve static web pages. This allowed me to use `react` and `AR.js` together.


### Not every browser is created equal
#### On mobile it didn't work well with every browser, so I had to find a workaround for browsers where the `AR functionality` didn't work as expected.

The solution of this problem was quite easy. Browsers where it didn't work well just show a fallback
webpage where the user can click on the title of the image in the magazine and then see the related
video.
